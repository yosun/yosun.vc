As Professor Lillian-Yvonne Bertram titled her GPT-generated book, *A Black Story May Contain Sensitive Content*, and albeit I come from people who hide such stories even amongst themselves, please be warned that: A Taiwanese-American Story May Contain Sensitive Content. 

When I was in 11th grade, self-esteem nullified by my Taiwanese post-war complex PTSD (and pituitary gland tumor survivor) father's random bouts of violent anger, bereft of para-coeval bullies, I was vulnerable and scarred by a teacher bully with a nepotic political situation that resulted in the academic equivalent of a scarlet letter.  

 Despite being powerful as a teacher, she felt threatened by how due to adverse circumstances, I was already a self-made woman. My underqualified high school AP Physics teacher needed to create her own teacher's pet, to groom a perfect candidate for top private colleges that everyone coveted. The candidate had to be a smart Asian girl - but not yet that accomplished. 

Her genius in being a teacher sadly was in inventions to dock random points off my work for no valid reason.

She tried out a new homework scheme, where she would check everyday to make sure the homework is done, then stamp it, but wouldn't collect it until 2 weeks later. There was a format the homework was to be written in, in order to receive a stamp. Randomly, one day, she decided mine was not in the right format. I asked her for clarification but was given none, in a way one would handwave to justify original sin. 

I requested a friend to send me a scan of the missing stamp. Coming from a poor family who was smart enough to get into a good school district, but misunderstood finances to figure out how to stay in it stably, I made side cash to help by Photoshopping the perfect fake IDs. And so, to the unlikely awe and amazement of friends, I made the perfect stamp replica.

About two weeks later, after assigning us some busywork to do during class, she reviewed the collected homework. Heads down working on an assignment in class, there was a moment when I felt that proverbial burning sensation like someone was intensely staring at me - I looked up and saw her glaring at me with murderous intent.  

From pieces overheard from whisperings about me, I would put together what happened later that afternoon. 

There was a monthly teacher's meeting after school and she ran in screaming, "Everyone, don't write a recommendation letter for her! Yosun cheated on her homework!"

And so I didn't get to go to a private college - in situ when that mattered as water might to a parched traveler about to die of dehydration in the desert. 

In context of epigenetics and what happened to my intellectual-thus-exiled grandfather during the PRC Cultural Revolution, I understand why a machinated Jabberwocky nonsense was so deeply triggering. Complex injustice used to nullify your future.

That was the moment that sealed the tunnel into my path down the dark tunnel as an outsider, not worthy enough, too incompetent to even be able to figure things out, even though I desired so much to be part of a community.

Festering for years, the wound grew for me in size bigger than Cyrano de Bergerac's nose. I judged myself as stupid, incapable of telling the truth against those in power who'd abuse their power - but it was an artistic absolute truth that I believed in, which exists qua being without being uttered. I cheated on homework in a system that was purposefully designed against me; I self-exiled; I suffered; and, I have lived to tell the story.
