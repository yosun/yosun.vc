# Expressive Computing 

Expressive computing is the practice of computing with whatever one has the means and access to, in order to maintain a sense of agency and expressiveness for the human creator. 

In my case, this has been whatever I can build with solo. I'm very fortunate to be living at a time where stygmergy in computing makes possible what would usually take billions of dollars and battalions of researchers and engineers. It's like standing on the shoulders of giants, but often you don't have to deal with the politics of the powerful: I am grateful for the numerous libraries in opensource and SDKs from commercial companies that just show up right when I need them. 

I like to play with emerging technologies and utilize them as building blocks in implementing [visionary computing](visionary_computing.md). Think of this like an abstract algebra version of assembling circuits with logic gates; but, let's take our gates to Hilbert space, and perhaps elevate human intuition as a magical operator in order to collapse our wave function to solutions that converge into "things that work" - back in our reality, again. 

I'm the rare bird who has somehow never taken a corporate job, ever. It's been a mix of curing paradox of choice by galvanizing it with the state of resources available for quotidian practical computing that's forward enough to be considered "hard" or innovative - my crutch as an [[hacker-entrepreneur.md]].
