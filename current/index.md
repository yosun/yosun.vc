Currently, I'm building AI [creator apps](https://yosun.vc/creatorapps) that let you have better frame by frame control over your AI video generations. My on-going work with (my [non-traditional hacker in residence](https://yosun.vc/hacker-entrepreneur.html) take on) [AI3D Foundation](https://ai3d.dev) in utilizing XR breakthrough HCI techniques with AI to make 3D creation more intuitive and [magical](https://speedrun.aimagical.com/) - continues with a focus on [AI3D Render](https://yosun.vc/creatorapps/ai3d-render) and its variations this year, selected to present at [CVPR](https://yosun.vc/conferences/cvpr) and [SIGGRAPH](https://yosun.vc/conferences/siggraph). 

I am also taking perhaps the most indie scholar approach possible at XPRIZE Quantum Computing. I'm exploring symmetries in quantum algorithms, and forging forward with hyper-experimental HCI with a new way to create qc algos using a spatial computing paradigm - call it an AI3D Quantum Computer. 

My crutch is high creative x technical output, and I'm grateful to be sustained 100% by winning hackathons the past year, but remain open to hacking out MVP client projects @ Prototype48.com and/or through my startup studio PERMUTE.xyz.
